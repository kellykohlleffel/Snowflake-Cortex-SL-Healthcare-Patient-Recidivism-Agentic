### Introduction (3 minutes)

**[Slide: CarePathway Healthcare AI Agents Overview]**

"Thank you for joining today. I'm [Name] from [Company], and I'm excited to demonstrate how autonomous AI agents are transforming healthcare workflows to improve patient outcomes while reducing operational costs.

As healthcare leaders, you're facing unprecedented challenges:

- Care coordinators spend 3+ hours daily manually reviewing discharge reports to identify high-risk patients
- Population health managers struggle to track deteriorating chronic conditions across thousands of patients
- Prior authorization teams process 50+ complex cases daily, each taking 45 minutes to review
- Quality teams spend 4+ hours on retrospective chart reviews to identify safety events

The statistics paint a compelling picture:
- 20% of patients are readmitted within 30 days
- Each preventable readmission costs an average of $15,000
- Manual clinical workflows consume 60-75% of clinical staff time
- Healthcare organizations lose $1.8M annually from inefficient care coordination

Today, I'll show you how CarePathway's autonomous AI agents execute complex healthcare workflows with multi-step reasoning, reducing manual review time by 75% while improving clinical accuracy and generating over $2.5M in annual savings for a typical 500-bed hospital.

In the next 30 minutes, you'll see five specialized AI agents that demonstrate the art of the possible for transforming your clinical operations."

### Business Challenge Context (2 minutes)

**[Slide: The Healthcare Workflow Challenge]**

"The challenge isn't a lack of clinical data – it's that critical insights are trapped across disconnected systems and buried under manual processes:

- Patient risk factors scattered across Epic, Cerner, and Meditech systems
- Claims data isolated in payer systems like Optum, Humana, and Aetna
- Risk assessments locked in population health platforms
- Clinical events buried in laboratory and pharmacy systems

When care coordinators need to identify patients requiring immediate intervention, they're manually piecing together information from 5-7 different systems. A task that should take minutes consumes hours.

CarePathway solves this by deploying autonomous AI agents that automatically analyze integrated healthcare data through Snowflake Cortex, executing complex clinical workflows that previously required extensive manual effort. These agents don't just provide insights – they act as virtual clinical analysts, reasoning through complex scenarios and generating evidence-based recommendations."

#### Initial Wow Factor (2 minutes)

"Let me jump right in and show you something transformational. This is CarePathway's autonomous healthcare AI agent platform in action.

*[Navigate to the Cortex AI Clinical Agents tab]*

You're looking at five specialized AI agents, each designed to execute complex healthcare workflows that typically consume hours of clinical staff time. Let me demonstrate the Proactive Care Management Agent – imagine this as your virtual senior care coordinator.

*[Select the Proactive Care Management Agent tab]*

This agent addresses the challenge we discussed: care coordinators spending hours manually reviewing discharge reports. Watch as I deploy this agent to analyze recent discharges and identify high-risk patients requiring immediate intervention.

*[Select Snowflake Cortex model and click 'Start Proactive Care Management Agent']*

*[Watch agent progress indicators]*

Notice how the agent is executing a sophisticated workflow:
- Loading and validating patient data with enhanced quality checks
- Analyzing recent discharge patterns with clinical terminology  
- Performing advanced readmission risk calculations using evidence-based patterns
- Conducting deep care gap analysis with clinical context
- Reviewing clinical events with AI-powered pattern recognition

*[Wait for completion and show generated report]*

In just minutes, this agent has analyzed data from multiple sources and generated a comprehensive clinical report that would typically take a care coordinator 2-3 hours to produce manually. The agent identified specific high-risk patients, quantified care gaps, and provided evidence-based intervention recommendations.

This is the power of autonomous AI workflows in healthcare. Now let me show you how we build this foundation with integrated data."

#### Healthcare Data Foundation (3 minutes)

"The foundation of these AI agents is comprehensive healthcare data integration. 

*[Navigate to the Patient Explorer tab]*

In CarePathway, you can see we've integrated five critical healthcare data domains:
- Patient demographics and risk stratification from EHR systems
- Clinical encounters tracking visits, admissions, and readmissions
- Clinical events including procedures, medications, and lab results
- Claims information from multiple payers
- Risk scores from assessment platforms

*[Show metrics and filtering capabilities]*

Notice how patients are automatically risk-stratified as Low, Medium, or High risk based on AI analysis. Your care teams get immediate visibility into patients across different risk categories, with real-time insights into geographic distribution and demographic patterns.

*[Filter for high-risk patients]*

These high-risk patients would typically be scattered across different care teams without a unified view. Now your teams have immediate visibility into who needs attention most, with AI-powered risk calculations updating in real-time as new data flows in."

*[Show completed analysis]*

The agent identified specific cohorts requiring attention: diabetes patients with poor adherence, hypertension patients with escalating risk, and high-impact intervention opportunities. This analysis would typically require a population health manager an entire day to complete manually."

#### Prior Authorization Intelligence (2 minutes)

"For your utilization management teams, our Prior Authorization Agent revolutionizes medical necessity validation.

*[Navigate to Prior Authorization Agent tab]*

This agent tackles the challenge of prior authorization teams spending 45 minutes per case to assess medical necessity and financial risk.

*[Start the Prior Authorization Agent]*

*[Show agent workflow]*

The agent is performing sophisticated claims pattern analysis, medical necessity validation using evidence-based criteria, and cost-benefit modeling with advanced optimization algorithms.

*[Show results]*

In minutes, the agent analyzed authorization patterns, validated medical necessity for claims, and identified optimization opportunities. Your utilization management teams can now focus on complex cases while the agent handles routine validations."

#### Quality & Safety Surveillance (2 minutes)

"Our Quality & Safety Surveillance Agent provides continuous monitoring that transforms patient safety.

*[Navigate to Quality & Safety Agent tab]*

This addresses quality teams spending hours on retrospective chart reviews to identify safety events.

*[Start the Quality & Safety Agent]*

*[Show agent execution]*

The agent is performing advanced safety event detection, quality measure assessment across core conditions, and systematic risk pattern recognition with AI-powered insights.

*[Show completed analysis]*

The agent identified readmission events, frequent ED users, and quality metrics across conditions like heart failure, diabetes, and pneumonia care. It detected 15 high-utilizer patients requiring case management and generated specific quality improvement recommendations.

This continuous surveillance enables proactive intervention rather than reactive responses to safety events."

#### Operations Optimization (2 minutes)

"Finally, our Operations Optimization Agent tackles resource allocation and efficiency challenges.

*[Navigate to Operations Optimization Agent tab]*

This agent addresses operations managers spending hours analyzing utilization patterns and missing optimization opportunities.

*[Start the Operations Optimization Agent]*
