### Opening: Partnership Opportunity (3 minutes)

**[Slide: Fivetran + Snowflake Healthcare GTM Opportunity]**

"Thank you for joining today. I'm [Name] from Fivetran, and I'm here to demonstrate why a joint go-to-market partnership between Fivetran and Snowflake in healthcare represents a massive revenue opportunity for both our organizations.

The healthcare AI market is exploding:
- $45.2B market by 2026 with 44.9% CAGR (MarketsandMarkets)
- 14% of healthcare CIOs prioritizing AI initiatives as third most critical initiative in 2025 (CHIME CIO Survey)
- AI-enabled healthcare startups raise $34.4M average funding per roundâ€”83% premium over non-AI companies (Rock Health 2025)
- 85% of AI projects fail due to data quality and integration challenges (Gartner/Plan B AI)

**This is where our partnership becomes powerful.**

Today, I'll show you how Fivetran + Snowflake delivers unmatched value through five key differentiators:

**1. Simplicity & Reliability That Just Works**
- Fivetran + Snowflake: Zero-maintenance data pipelines with enterprise-grade reliability
- Healthcare customers get 99.9% uptime without dedicated engineering teams

**2. Speed to Business Impact** 
- Healthcare can't wait 18 months for AI - they need Gen AI impact NOW
- Joint solution: Weeks to production vs. competitors' 12+ month implementations

**3. Unmatched Optionality**
- Fivetran: 750+ connectors + Connector SDK for any custom healthcare source
- Snowflake: Complete AI/ML framework - vector database, ranking, LLMs built-in
- No more piecemeal AI stack assembly - everything integrated and ready

**4. Security & Governance Throughout**
- End-to-end security: Data, Apps, AI all within Fivetran-Snowflake environment
- HIPAA compliance, SOC 2, healthcare-grade governance by design

**5. Self-Service & Automated**
- No long build cycles - idea to production in weeks, not quarters
- Healthcare teams build AI workflows without engineering bottlenecks

**Results for Joint Customers:**
- **3x faster time-to-value** 
- **60% higher win rates** in competitive healthcare deals
- **$500K+ average incremental Snowflake consumption** per healthcare customer
- **Compelling competitive differentiation** against Microsoft, Google, and AWS

In 30 minutes, you'll see exactly why healthcare customers choose Fivetran + Snowflake over alternative platforms, and how this translates into accelerated revenue growth for both companies."

### The Healthcare Data Challenge (2 minutes)

**[Slide: Why Healthcare AI Projects Fail]**

"Before I show you the solution, let me frame the challenge that makes our partnership so valuable.

Healthcare organizations have the most complex data environments of any industry:
- **20+ disparate source systems**: Epic, Cerner, Meditech, Allscripts, lab systems, pharmacy systems, claims platforms
- **Strict compliance requirements**: HIPAA, SOX, state privacy laws
- **Real-time clinical decision requirements**: Patient safety depends on fresh, accurate data
- **Legacy integration nightmares**: Most healthcare IT teams spend 70% of their time on data plumbing

**The result?** 85% of healthcare AI initiatives stall in the data integration phase. Customers get excited about Cortex AI capabilities, but can't get their data into Snowflake fast enough to realize value.

### Live Demo: The Fivetran + Snowflake Advantage (20 minutes)

**[Switch to CarePathway Application]**

#### The Complete Healthcare AI Platform (3 minutes)

"Let me show you what's possible when Fivetran and Snowflake work together to deliver healthcare AI solutions that JUST WORK.

*[Navigate to CarePathway application homepage]*

What you're seeing is CarePathway - a healthcare AI agent platform that demonstrates our complete joint value proposition. This isn't just another demo - it's proof that Fivetran + Snowflake solves healthcare's biggest challenge: getting from data to AI impact FAST.

**The "Just Works" Factor:**
Notice the architecture flow at the bottom:
1. **Healthcare Source Systems** (Epic, Cerner, 750+ sources via Fivetran)
2. **Fivetran** - Zero-maintenance, automated data movement
3. **Snowflake** - Complete AI platform with Cortex built-in
4. **AI Agents** - Self-service clinical intelligence
5. **Measurable Business Outcomes** - In weeks, not years

**Speed to Business Impact:**
Healthcare organizations can't wait 18 months for AI value. With our joint platform:
- **Week 1-2**: Fivetran connects ANY healthcare source automatically
- **Week 3-4**: Data flows into Snowflake's integrated AI framework
- **Week 5**: Healthcare teams are building AI agents without engineering teams

**Complete Optionality Without Complexity:**
- Fivetran's 750+ connectors + Connector SDK = ANY healthcare data source
- Snowflake Cortex = Complete AI stack (vector DB, LLMs, ranking) pre-integrated
- No more assembling 15 different AI tools - everything works together seamlessly

This is the story we tell together: **Fivetran + Snowflake = Healthcare AI that just works, delivered fast, with complete security and governance.**"

#### Fivetran's Healthcare Data Foundation (4 minutes)

"The secret to our joint success is Fivetran + Snowflake's 'it just works' approach to healthcare's biggest data challenge.

*[Navigate to Settings tab and scroll to Data Overview section]*

Look at this data overview - we're automatically integrating five critical healthcare data domains:
- **Patients table**: Demographics and risk stratification from EHR systems
- **Encounters table**: Clinical visits and readmission tracking  
- **Clinical Events table**: Procedures, medications, lab results
- **Claims table**: Financial data from payers
- **Risk Scores table**: Predictive analytics and care gaps

*[Click on Load Sample Data for different tables]*

**The 'Just Works' Advantage:**
Each table represents a different source system that traditionally takes 6-12 months for healthcare IT teams to integrate. With Fivetran, we get all of this flowing into Snowflake in WEEKS, not months.

**750+ Connectors + Connector SDK:**
- Pre-built: Epic, Cerner, Meditech, Allscripts, Quest, LabCorp
- Custom: Connector SDK for any proprietary healthcare system
- No engineering required - healthcare teams can connect anything

*[Show schema information]*

**Automated Schema Evolution:**
Notice the automatic schema detection and evolution. Healthcare data models change frequently - new ICD-10 codes, updated HL7 standards, evolving FHIR specifications. Fivetran handles all of this automatically, so healthcare customers never have broken pipelines.

**Snowflake's Complete AI Framework:**
While Fivetran solves data integration, Snowflake provides the complete AI stack:
- Vector database built-in (no separate Pinecone needed)
- LLM ranking and orchestration (no separate LangChain needed)  
- Multiple Cortex models ready to use (no separate OpenAI contracts)
- Security and governance throughout (no separate compliance tools)

**This is where we win deals together.** While competitors are still building custom ETL pipelines and assembling 15 different AI tools, we're delivering Gen AI insights to clinical teams - FAST."

#### Cortex AI Use Cases Enabled by Fivetran Data (5 minutes)

"Now let me show you the AI applications that this foundation enables - and why our 'self-service + automated' approach creates massive Snowflake consumption growth.

*[Navigate to Cortex AI Clinical Agents tab]*

These five AI agents represent different healthcare workflows, each powered by Snowflake Cortex analyzing Fivetran-integrated data with ZERO engineering overhead:

**Self-Service AI Agent Building:**
*[Start the Proactive Care Management Agent]*

*[Show workflow execution]*

Watch this agent analyze integrated data from all five tables automatically. Healthcare teams built this workflow themselves using Snowflake's complete AI framework - no separate tools needed:
- Vector database queries (built into Snowflake)
- LLM orchestration (Cortex handles it)
- Multi-table analytics (native Snowflake)
- Real-time processing (auto-scaling)

*[Show generated report]*

**Speed to Business Impact:**
This agent went from idea to production in 3 weeks:
- Week 1: Fivetran connected data sources automatically
- Week 2: Healthcare team built AI workflow using Snowflake's self-service tools
- Week 3: Production deployment with built-in governance and security

**Complete Platform Optionality:**
*[Quickly demonstrate another agent]*

*[Start Population Health Manager Agent]*

Each agent leverages Snowflake's complete AI platform:
- **Multiple Cortex models** available instantly (Claude, Llama, Mistral)
- **Built-in vector database** for semantic search
- **Integrated ML pipelines** for predictive analytics
- **End-to-end security** with data never leaving Snowflake

**Consumption Gold for Snowflake:**
- **High-frequency, compute-intensive queries** across multiple tables
- **Continuous Cortex AI model invocations** for clinical insights
