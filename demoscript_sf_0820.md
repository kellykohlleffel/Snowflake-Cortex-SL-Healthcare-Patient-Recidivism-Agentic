### The Healthcare Data Challenge (2 minutes)

**[Slide: Why Healthcare AI Projects Fail]**

"Before I show you the solution, let me frame the challenge that makes our partnership so valuable.

Healthcare organizations have the most complex data environments of any industry:
- **20+ disparate source systems**: Epic, Cerner, Meditech, Allscripts, lab systems, pharmacy systems, claims platforms
- **Strict compliance requirements**: HIPAA, SOX, state privacy laws
- **Real-time clinical decision requirements**: Patient safety depends on fresh, accurate data
- **Legacy integration nightmares**: Most healthcare IT teams spend 70% of their time on data plumbing

**The result?** 85% of healthcare AI initiatives stall in the data integration phase. Customers get excited about Cortex AI capabilities, but can't get their data into Snowflake fast enough to realize value.
